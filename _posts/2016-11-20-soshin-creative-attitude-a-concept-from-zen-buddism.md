Shoshin comes from [Zen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen), which is a school of thought that emphasizes meditation and self-control.

From [Shoshin's Wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoshin),
<pre><code>Shoshin is a concept in Zen Buddhism meaning "beginner’s mind". It refers to having an attitude of openness, eagerness, and lack of preconceptions when studying a subject, even when studying at an advanced level, just as a beginner in that subject would.</code></pre>

And according to [Shunryu Suzuki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunry%C5%AB_Suzuki), who was at the forefront in spreading Zen Buddhism in the United States:
<pre><code>In the beginner’s mind there are many possibilities, but in the expert’s there are few</code></pre>

Creativity and innovation comes from new thoughts, or a mixture of new thoughts and old thoughts. Therefore, in order to be creative and innovative, we should learn to be open to new ideas. This is what Shoshin teaches us. We should learn to have a mind of newness, so we can trace new paths in our thought process.

This lesson can also be applied to people as well. Having a pre conceived thought about a person can misinform you about the words spoken by such person. This could also be in the form of being dismissive on the ideas on a younger person or a beginner, simply because one already has already his/her own belief system. Focus should be more on the message, as opposed to the messenger. This will make you a happier and more creative person, because
<pre><code>The happier you are, the more creative you become.</code></pre>

#### **Knowledge is Power**

Power comes from knowledge. And knowledge comes from universe around you. You can't follow all the paths in life yourself. But you can follow the important paths, only if you learn from the paths of those before and around you in order to discover your own path and also leave a trail for those behind or beside you.

The most powerful people don't necessarily know how to shoot a gun. They simply have a head full of Knowledge - **Wisdom**.

Doing the same things would most probably lead to the same results.  



Have and open mind like a child, live anew today and discover new paths in your life!.  
**Have a beginner's mind!**.
